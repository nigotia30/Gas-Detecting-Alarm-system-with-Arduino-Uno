# Gas-Detecting-Alarm-system-with-Arduino-Uno
This project (gas detector and alarm)is a useful application in real-time. It plays a major role where there is a need to check the leakage of any hazardous chemicals in places like factories. It can be used in our own houses to check if there is any leakage of LPG gas from the cylinders and immediately alert people in the house. This device ensures the safety of people from hazardous chemicals if exposed might even lead to the death of many.
